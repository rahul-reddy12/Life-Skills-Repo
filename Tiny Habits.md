1) **In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting idea for me in the video was how tiny habits can be connected to things we already do, like brushing our teeth. For example, flossing one tooth after brushing or doing two push-ups after using the bathroom. It showed me that small changes in my daily routine can grow into bigger habits. I also liked the idea of celebrating small wins because it helps to keep the habit going.

2) **How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.**

B = MAP means Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and Prompt come together.

M (Motivation): Your desire to do something. 
A (Ability): How easy it is to do the behavior. 
P (Prompt): The cue or reminder to start the behavior. 
To make new habits easier, choose habits that are simple (easy ability), use a clear prompt, and don't rely too much on motivation, which can change.

3) **Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)**

It is important to celebrate after each habit because it makes you feel good about what you did. When you feel happy, your brain connects that feeling with the habit, so youâ€™re more likely to do it again. Celebration builds confidence and creates a positive emotion, which makes the habit enjoyable and easier to repeat in the future. It helps you stay motivated and see progress, even with small steps.

4) **In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting idea for me in the video was the idea of small improvements adding up to big results. James Clear explained that tiny changes in different areas of life can make a big difference over time. He also talked about how good habits help you improve, while bad habits stop you from growing. This made me realize that small changes in my daily routine can lead to big success later on.

5) **What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

The book says that to build habits, you need to focus on changing your identity. Instead of just doing a habit, think of yourself as the type of person who does it. This makes the habit feel more natural and easier to stick with.

6) **Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?**

To make a habit easier, break it down into smaller steps and remove any obstacles. Make the habit as simple and convenient as possible, so it's easier to do. The less effort it takes, the more likely you are to do it.

7) **Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?**

To make a habit harder, add obstacles or increase the effort needed. For example, make it less convenient to do the habit or hide things that trigger it. The more difficult it is, the less likely you are to do it.

8) **Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?**

I would like to do more exercise. To make the cue obvious, I can set out my workout clothes the night before as a reminder. To make it more attractive, I can listen to my favorite music while exercising. To make it easier, I can start with short workouts and gradually increase the time. After finishing, I can celebrate by treating myself to a healthy snack or a relaxing shower, making the response satisfying.

9) **Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?**

I would like to eliminate excessive phone usage. To make the cue invisible, I can turn off unnecessary notifications or keep my phone in another room. To make the process unattractive, I can remove apps that waste time or place them in less accessible folders. To make the response unsatisfying, I can limit my phone usage to only specific times of the day, making it harder to use whenever I want.

## 1) Steps/Strategies for Active Listening

1. Avoid distractions and keep your mind on the conversation.
2. Wait until they’re done before responding.
3. Say things like “I see” or “Go on” to show you’re interested and encourage them to keep talking.
4. Nod, make eye contact, and face the speaker to show that you’re listening carefully.
5. Write down key points during important conversations. This helps you remember and stay engaged.

## 2) Key Points of Reflective Listening According to Fisher's Model

1. Listen carefully to what the speaker is saying without distractions. This helps you understand their message fully.
2. Notice the speaker's emotions and body language, and reflect these in your responses. This shows empathy and makes the speaker feel understood.
3. Repeat back what you understood in your own words. This helps both you and the speaker confirm that you understood the message correctly.
4. Allow the speaker to finish their thoughts without cutting them off. This ensures that they feel heard and respected.

Reflective listening, as per Fisher's model, focuses on understanding both the words and emotions behind the message, creating a supportive and empathetic conversation.

## 3) What are the obstacles in your listening process?

- **Distractions**: Background noise or my own thoughts can make it hard to focus fully on the speaker.
- **Interrupting**: Sometimes I get excited or think I already know what the speaker will say, so I interrupt.
- **Lack of Patience**: If the speaker is talking slowly or repeating things, I might lose interest or stop paying close attention.

## 4) What can you do to improve your listening?

- I can make an effort to ignore distractions and pay full attention to the speaker. Allow the speaker to finish their thoughts without interrupting or rushing them.
- Writing down key points can help me remember important details.  Use encouraging words, nod, and make eye contact to stay engaged.

## Question 5: When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?

- I tend to switch to a passive communication style when I want to avoid conflict, especially in situations where I feel uncomfortable
- For example, if I disagree with someone but don’t want to upset them, I might hold back my thoughts.

## Question 6: When do you switch to Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?

- I sometimes switch to an aggressive style when I feel frustrated or believe that I'm not being heard.
- This can happen if I’ve tried expressing myself but feel ignored, leading me to raise my voice or speak more forcefully than I intended.

## Question 7: When do you switch to Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day-to-day life?

- I might use passive-aggressive communication when I feel frustrated but don't want to confront the issue directly.
- For instance, if someone doesn’t complete their part of a group task, I might make a sarcastic comment instead of openly addressing it.

## Question 8: How can you make your communication assertive?

- Take a moment to understand what I feel and what I need before speaking. This can help me communicate more clearly. Clearly state my thoughts and needs without blaming or putting down others.
- Try to be consistent with assertive communication in daily interactions and be patient with myself as I improve.

## Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

- The emphasis on over-communicating, like informing team members about minor disruptions (e.g., internet or laptop issues), stood out as something I hadn’t fully considered before.
- Using tools like Loom for screencasts or GitHub gists for sharing code snippets was new and seems like a very effective way to communicate technical issues clearly.
- The idea of joining meetings 5-10 minutes early to build rapport with teammates is a small but impactful step I hadn't thought of before.

## Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

I think I need to improve on managing my focus and avoiding distractions during work. I often get sidetracked by notifications or social media. 
To address this, I plan to use tools like Freedom to block distracting sites and keep notifications limited to work-related apps. 
Additionally, I’ll follow the advice to manage food intake and incorporate short exercise sessions to maintain energy and concentration throughout the day. 
This structured approach should help me stay more productive.

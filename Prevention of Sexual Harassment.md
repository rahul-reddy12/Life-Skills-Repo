# 1) What Kinds of Behavior Cause Sexual Harassment?

Sexual harassment includes different types of behaviors that make someone feel uncomfortable or unsafe at work. Here are some examples:

## Verbal Harassment:
- **Unwelcome Comments:** This means saying things that are sexual or suggestive that the person does not want to hear.
- **Jokes:** Making jokes that are sexual in nature can hurt others and create a bad atmosphere.
- **Requests for Sexual Favors:** Asking someone to do something sexual in exchange for a job benefit is not acceptable.
- **Threats:** Threatening someone if they do not agree to sexual advances is also harassment.

## Visual Harassment:
- **Sexually Suggestive Images:** Showing pictures, posters, or materials that are sexual in nature is a form of harassment.
- **Inappropriate Messages:** Sending emails or texts that have sexual content can make someone feel uncomfortable.

## Physical Harassment:
- **Inappropriate Touching:** Touching someone in a way that is sexual or unwanted is harassment.
- **Sexual Assault:** This is a serious form of harassment that involves forcing someone into sexual acts against their will.

All these behaviors are wrong and create a negative work environment for everyone. It is important to recognize them and take action to stop them.

# 2) What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

- If I faced or witnessed sexual harassment, I would document everything. This means noting down what happened, when, where, and who was involved.
- If I felt safe, I might consider telling the person their behavior is making me uncomfortable and ask them to stop.
- I would report the incident to someone in charge, like HR or a supervisor, so it can be properly addressed.
- If someone else was being harassed, I would offer support and encourage them to report it.
- I would check if my company has any policies or resources about harassment to understand the process better.
- I would also follow up after reporting to make sure action is being taken to address the issue.
- I would seek advice from a trusted colleague or mentor on how best to handle the situation if I needed guidance.
- I would keep my documentation secure and private to ensure confidentiality.
- If no action was taken after reporting, I would consider escalating the issue to a higher authority or an external organization.
- I would be mindful of my own well-being, seeking support or counseling if needed to manage any stress or discomfort resulting from the incident.

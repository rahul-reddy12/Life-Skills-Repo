# Full Text Search Databases: Elasticsearch, Solr, and Lucene

## Introduction
Our current project has issues with search speed and scaling as data grows. To improve the search performance, we’re exploring options for databases that support "full text search." The team lead suggested looking into three popular choices: **Elasticsearch**, **Apache Solr**, and **Apache Lucene**. 

## 1. Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is widely used for quick and efficient data search and analysis. It’s particularly effective for projects that need rapid, real-time search results.

* **Key Features**:
  - Offers real-time search and analytics
  - Easily scalable by adding more servers
  - Provides a RESTful API for easy integration
  - Capable of handling complex queries and filters
* **Ideal For**:
  - Real-time applications, like log monitoring or activity tracking
  - E-commerce platforms where users perform frequent searches
  - Any application requiring fast, large-scale search capabilities

## 2. Apache Solr
Apache Solr is another high-performance search platform designed for large datasets. Many companies rely on Solr for its powerful search features and efficient data management.

* **Key Features**:
  - Supports advanced distributed search
  - Includes faceted search capabilities (e.g., filtering by category)
  - Allows tuning of search results to enhance relevance
* **Ideal For**:
  - Large-scale applications, such as enterprise systems
  - Websites with extensive filtering and high search volume
  - Applications that require fine control over search functionality

## 3. Apache Lucene
Apache Lucene is a flexible, Java-based search library that provides the core search and indexing capabilities behind both Elasticsearch and Solr.

* **Key Features**:
  - High-speed indexing and searching
  - Customizable search parameters and scoring options
  - Open-source and adaptable to various search needs
* **Ideal For**:
  - Java applications needing basic search functionality
  - Custom projects where specific search algorithms are required
  - Applications requiring full control over search setup

## Conclusion
Each option is suited to specific scenarios:
* **Elasticsearch** is optimal for real-time, fast-paced search needs.
* **Solr** is robust for big data applications with complex search requirements.
* **Lucene** works well for Java-based custom search applications.

Switching to one of these specialized tools can help resolve current search performance challenges and improve the overall application performance.
